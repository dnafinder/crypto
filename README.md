A journey into cryptographic algorithms. <br>
We are developing MatLab algorithms to deal ciphers that are all solvable
by pencil and paper methods, using, as guide and resource, the website of 
the American Cryptogram Association (ACA)

http://www.cryptogram.org/resource-area/cipher-types/

Here you will find the fruits of several hundred years of development of 
cryptography. Some of the ACA systems were used historically in precisely 
the form we use; some are simplified to highlight unique aspects of that 
cipher type; and some were invented by ACA members. 
Moreover, we developed algorithms for other historical ciphers that are not
listed into the ACA website.
