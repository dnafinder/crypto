function out=playfair(text,key,direction)
% PLAYFAIR CIPHER encoder/decoder
% The Playfair cipher was the first cipher to encrypt pairs of letters in
% cryptologic history. Wheatstone invented the cipher for secrecy in
% telegraphy, but it carries the name of his friend Lord Playfair, first
% Baron Playfair of St. Andrews, who promoted its use. Playfair is no
% longer used by military forces because of the advent of digital
% encryption devices. This cipher is now regarded as insecure for any
% purpose, because modern computers could easily break it within seconds.   
% Playfair Cipher is based onto Polybius Square.
%
% Syntax: 	out=playfair(text,key,direction)
%
%     Input:
%           text - It is a characters array to encode or decode
%           key - It is the keyword
%           direction - this parameter can assume only two values: 
%                   1 to encrypt
%                  -1 to decrypt.
%     Output:
%           out - It is a structure
%           out.plain = the plain text
%           out.key = the used key
%           out.encrypted = the coded text
%
% Examples:
%
% out=playfair('Hide the gold in the tree stump','playfair example',1)
%
% out = 
% 
%   struct with fields:
% 
%         plain: 'HIDETHEGOLDINTHETREESTUMP'
%           key: 'PLAYFAIREXAMPLE'
%     encrypted: 'BMODZBXDNABEKUDMUIXMMOUVIF'
%
% out=playfair('BMODZBXDNABEKUDMUIXMMOUVIF','playfair example',-1)
%
% out = 
% 
%   struct with fields:
% 
%     encrypted: 'BMODZBXDNABEKUDMUIXMMOUVIF'
%           key: 'PLAYFAIREXAMPLE'
%         plain: 'HIDETHEGOLDINTHETREESTUMP'
